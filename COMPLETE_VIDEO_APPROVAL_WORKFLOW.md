# Complete Video Approval Workflow - All Source Types

## Overview
The enhanced video moderation system now properly handles videos from all sources with intelligent behavior based on the video's origin.

## Video Source Types Supported

### 1. Remotion-Generated Videos
- **Source**: `remotionlambda-useast1-3pwoq46nsa.s3.amazonaws.com`
- **Approval Behavior**: Automatically migrated to public CDN bucket
- **UI Indicator**: Blue "Remotion Video - Auto-Migration" badge
- **Migration**: Creates organized path in public bucket with metadata

### 2. Manually Uploaded Videos
- **Source**: `aiaio3-public-videos.s3.amazonaws.com` (direct upload)
- **Approval Behavior**: No migration needed, already optimized
- **UI Indicator**: Green "Public CDN Video" badge
- **Processing**: Approved with existing URL

### 3. Previously Migrated Videos  
- **Source**: `aiaio3-public-videos.s3.amazonaws.com` (with migration metadata)
- **Approval Behavior**: No migration needed
- **UI Indicator**: Green "Video Migrated" badge with migration date
- **Processing**: Approved with existing URL and preserved migration info

### 4. Other Video Sources
- **Source**: Any other URL (future-proofing)
- **Approval Behavior**: Approved with original URL
- **UI Indicator**: None (standard approval)
- **Processing**: No special handling

## Approval Logic Flow

```javascript
if (video_url.includes('remotionlambda')) {
  // Auto-migrate Remotion video
  newUrl = copyRemotionVideoToPublicBucket()
  migrationInfo = { originalUrl, migratedUrl, timestamp }
} else if (video_url.includes('aiaio3-public-videos')) {
  // Already in public bucket - no action needed
  console.log('✅ Video already in public bucket')
} else {
  // Unknown source - use original URL
  console.log('ℹ️ Video from unknown source')
}
```

## UI Status Indicators

### For Moderators
1. **Blue Badge**: "Remotion Video - Auto-Migration"
   - Shows when a video will be migrated on approval
   
2. **Green Badge**: "Public CDN Video" 
   - Shows when video is already in the public bucket (manually uploaded)
   
3. **Green Badge**: "Video Migrated"
   - Shows when video was previously migrated with timestamp

### Benefits
- ✅ Optimal CDN performance for all approved videos
- ✅ No unnecessary duplicate uploads
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for moderators
- ✅ Preserves migration history
- ✅ Handles all current and future video sources

## Migration Organization
Migrated videos are stored with organized paths:
```
aiaio3-public-videos/
├── approved-videos/
│   ├── 2025/
│   │   ├── 01/
│   │   │   ├── 13/
│   │   │   │   ├── videoId-ChildName-out.mp4
```

## Database Updates
- `video_url` updated to public URL for migrated videos
- `template_data.migration` preserves migration metadata
- All existing migration data is preserved during approval

## Error Handling
- Migration failures don't block approval
- Videos can be approved with original URL if migration fails
- Clear console logging for debugging

This system ensures that whether videos come from Remotion generation, manual upload, or any other source, they are handled appropriately and optimally for CDN delivery.
