# Enhanced Video Moderation with Auto-Migration

## What's Changed

Your video moderation workflow at `/admin/video-moderation` now includes **automatic video migration** when you approve Remotion videos.

## New Workflow

### 1. Video Generation (No Change)
```
Remotion creates video → stores in Remotion bucket
Status: "pending_review"
```

### 2. Video Moderation (Enhanced)
When you go to `/admin/video-moderation`, you'll now see:

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🔄 **"Auto-Migrate" badge** for Remotion videos that will be migrated when approved
- ✅ **"Migrated" badge** for videos already migrated to public bucket

**In Review Modal:**
- Blue info box explaining auto-migration for Remotion videos
- Green success box showing migration details for already migrated videos

### 3. Approval Process (Enhanced)
When you click **"Approve"** on a Remotion video:

```
1. 🔄 Auto-detects Remotion URL
2. 📤 Copies video to public bucket (aiaio3-public-videos)
3. 🔄 Updates database with new public URL
4. ✅ Marks video as approved
5. 📝 Adds migration metadata
```

**If migration fails:** Video is still approved with original URL (no workflow interruption)

### 4. Update Playlists (No Change)
```
Run /admin/update-child-playlists
Videos appear in child feeds with CDN URLs
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Seamless Integration
- No extra steps in your workflow
- Migration happens automatically when you approve
- Visual feedback shows migration status

### ✅ Performance Benefits
- Approved videos immediately get CDN acceleration
- Better video loading for children
- Reduced bandwidth costs

### ✅ Fallback Protection
- If migration fails, approval still works
- Original workflow preserved
- No data loss

## What You'll See

```

```

### After Approval (Migrated Video):

## Migration Details

**Original URL:**
```
https://remotionlambda-useast1-3pwoq46nsa.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/renders/abc123/out.mp4
```

**New Public URL:**
```
https://aiaio3-public-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/approved-videos/2025/01/13/video-id-childname-out.mp4
```

**Organized Structure:**
```
approved-videos/
  2025/
    01/
      13/
        video-id-Emma-out.mp4
        video-id-Noah-out.mp4
```

## Metadata Added

Each migrated video gets additional metadata:
```json
{
  "migration": {
    "originalUrl": "https://remotionlambda-.../out.mp4",
    "migratedUrl": "https://aiaio3-public-videos.../out.mp4", 
    "migratedAt": "2025-01-13T10:30:00Z",
    "migrationType": "auto-on-approval"
  }
}
```

## Testing

1. **Generate a video** using your existing Remotion process
2. **Go to video moderation** - you'll see the "Auto-Migrate" badge
3. **Click "Review Video"** - you'll see the migration info box
4. **Click "Approve"** - watch the console for migration logs
5. **Refresh the page** - you'll see the "Migrated" badge

## Alternative Options

If you prefer the manual workflow, you can:
1. Use the batch migration script: `/admin/migrate-remotion-videos`
2. Or just approve videos without migration (they'll still work)

The auto-migration is designed to be helpful but not disruptive to your existing process!
