# Video Approval S3 Migration Fix

## Problem Identified
When videos were approved in `/admin/video-moderation`, they were **not being moved to the S3 bucket for CDN** as intended.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/lib/video-approval.ts` - the file had **conflicting module export syntax**:

```typescript
// ‚ùå This was causing the module to fail loading
module.exports = { approveVideoWithMigration, copyRemotionVideoToPublicBucket };

// Also export for ES6 imports  
export { approveVideoWithMigration, copyRemotionVideoToPublicBucket };
```

**Error:** `ES Modules may not assign module.exports or exports.*, Use ESM export syntax, instead`

This caused the entire video approval module to fail when imported, preventing the S3 copy operation from executing.

## Fix Applied
**Removed the CommonJS export** and kept only the ES module export:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Fixed - ES module export only
export { approveVideoWithMigration, copyRemotionVideoToPublicBucket };
```

## Verification Completed
1. ‚úÖ **AWS credentials are properly configured** in `.env.local`
2. ‚úÖ **S3 buckets are accessible** (`remotionlambda-useast1-3pwoq46nsa` and `aiaio3-public-videos`)
3. ‚úÖ **Copy permissions work correctly** - tested successful file copy
4. ‚úÖ **Module now loads properly** in Next.js context
5. ‚úÖ **Video approval S3 migration is functional**

## Expected Behavior (Now Working)
When an admin approves a video in `/admin/video-moderation`:

1. **Detects Remotion videos** (URLs containing `remotionlambda`)
2. **Copies video** from `remotionlambda-useast1-3pwoq46nsa/renders/` to `aiaio3-public-videos/approved-videos/YYYY/MM/DD/`
3. **Updates video record** with new public URL
4. **Adds migration metadata** to track the migration
5. **Video is now served from CDN-enabled public bucket**

## Test Results
- üìÅ Source bucket access: ‚úÖ Working
- üìÅ Destination bucket access: ‚úÖ Working  
- üîÑ Video copy operation: ‚úÖ Working (tested with 22.7MB file)
- üß© Module loading: ‚úÖ Fixed
- üåê API integration: ‚úÖ Working

The video approval S3 migration feature is now **fully functional**.
