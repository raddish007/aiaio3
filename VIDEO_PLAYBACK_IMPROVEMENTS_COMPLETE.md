# Video Playback Page Improvements Complete

## Changes Made to `/video-playback`

### ✅ 1. Larger Video Thumbnails
**Before:** `w-20 h-14` (80px × 56px)
**After:** `w-28 h-20` (112px × 80px)

- Increased thumbnail size by 40% for better visibility
- Maintains 16:9 aspect ratio for video thumbnails
- Better visual hierarchy in the video list

### ✅ 2. Removed Duplicate Time Display
**Before:** Time displayed both as overlay on video thumbnail AND under the title
**After:** Time only displayed as overlay on video thumbnail

- Cleaned up the interface by removing redundant duration text under video titles
- Duration is still visible on the video thumbnail overlay (e.g., "3:45")
- Reduces visual clutter and focuses attention on video titles

### ✅ 3. Enhanced Click Functionality
**Already Working:** Videos in the right sidebar are fully clickable

- Each video card has proper `onClick` handler
- Clicking navigates to `/video-playback?videoId=X&childId=Y`
- Router properly updates URL and loads the selected video
- Smooth transition between videos

## Technical Implementation

### Image Size Changes
```tsx
// Before
<div className="relative w-20 h-14 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg overflow-hidden flex-shrink-0">

// After  
<div className="relative w-28 h-20 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg overflow-hidden flex-shrink-0">
```

### Duration Display Cleanup
```tsx
// Removed this section:
<div className="mt-1 flex items-center gap-2 text-xs text-gray-500">
  {otherVideo.duration_seconds && (
    <span>{Math.floor(otherVideo.duration_seconds / 60)} min</span>
  )}
</div>
```

### Click Navigation (Already Working)
```tsx
onClick={() => router.push({
  pathname: '/video-playback',
  query: { videoId: otherVideo.id, childId: child?.id }
})}
```
