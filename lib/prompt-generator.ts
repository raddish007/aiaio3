For human-like characters, show them in pajamas or tucked into bed if applicable.

üñºÔ∏è SAFE ZONE REQUIREMENTS

SLIDESHOW: The image is a simple, calm bedtime scene filling the entire frame. Composition must remain uncluttered, soothing, and age-appropriate. No text is included.

Each prompt must include:
Art Style: State the specified style (e.g. Pixar style).
Theme Description: Clearly describe the bedtime characters or objects, including:
- Species/breed/type if animals
- Color details (fur, pajamas, blankets, pillows, etc.)
- Expressions (calm, sleeping, peaceful)
- Pose (lying down asleep, curled up, sitting sleepily)
Placement Instructions:
- FRAME: Characters and objects arranged around the edges only; center area completely empty for title overlay with no overlap.
- SLIDESHOW: Calm, simple bedtime scene filling the frame with minimal elements and no text.
Background Description: State it is a single light, soft solid color background with no gradients, patterns, textures, scenery, or text.
Negative Instructions: Reinforce exclusion of complex backgrounds, busy scenes, text, dramatic poses, or frightening elements.`;
